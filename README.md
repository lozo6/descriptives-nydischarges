# descriptives-nydischagres
HHA 507 Assignment 4 Part 3

Create a new github repo called
‘descriptives-nydischarges’. 

Based on your learning(s) from Assignment 4 Part 1 and Assignment 4 Part 2,
take the following knowledge and apply it! Perform what you
believe would be necessary descriptive statistics that would be required to
understand the dataset ‘SPARKS’ from NYDOH used in Class 3, but the 2016
version. 

The 2016 data set can be found here (link; https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/gnzp-ekau). 

This descriptive analysis should be detailed enough so a physician or nurse
could understand what information is contained in the dataset, and what
potentially questions might be asked and answered. 


**I recommend that you try and create at least one descriptive table using the tableone
package.
